<p>253 Commonwealth Ave is the hub of the hub of the universe. Whom
among us does not recall the house and all that it meant and still
means to us? Living at the house was the foundation around which our
MIT experience was built, and having lived there is still a large part
of our lives. As we know, college friendships last a very long time.</p>
<p>Much is changing on campus due to the Coronavirus (see sidebar), and
the house will be effectively shut down for over a year. No summer
renters or undergraduates are allowed in the house through at least
the rest of 2020. But we are lucky, between the cash reserve we had
built up and some support from MIT the house will be Ok in the
immediate term.</p>
<p>However, besides the fact that we will be draining our reserves, this
has shown us that bad things can happen(™). Things that can put the
survival of the house at risk. Right now, some of the other houses at
MIT are in danger. They can’t pay their bills or their property
taxes, and could even lose their houses. We need an endowment in
order to secure the house and ensure that we can continue to provide
future students with the same great experience we were able to
have. So let’s fix that together.</p>
<h2 id="122m-dollar-capital-campaign">$1.22M dollar Capital Campaign<a href="#122m-dollar-capital-campaign" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>“One million here, one million there, soon you are talking about real money” - E. Dirksen (paraphrased)</p>
<h4 id="our-goal">Our Goal<a href="#our-goal" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Our goal is to create an endowment that can pay the property taxes on
253 Commonwealth from the interest. After this goal is met, we would
like to continue to grow this endowment to cover all the remaining
fixed costs associated with the house (insurance, sufficient heat to
make sure pipes don’t burst, etc). Besides ensuring our survival,
this would also let us fund repairs and improvements from operating
cash flows without having to further mortgage the property just to
keep it standing.</p>
<p>We want to raise $1.22 million dollars over 10 years, with an initial
milestone of $222,222 by Graduation Day 2022, and ongoing donations of
$69,000/year thereafter These funds would be put into a highly rated
bond fund or other investment, and the interest payments would be
earmarked for our fixed costs (property taxes, mortgage payments, and
the like).</p>
<p>While this is a large sum, we <em>can</em> get there &ndash; If every alum donates
$2,222 we would exceed our final goal. We know that not everybody
will be able to make this contribution. Please don’t let our ambitious
goals keep you from contributing. And if you can provide more, please
do.</p>
<h4 id="honigs-heroes-matching-fund">Honig’s Heroes Matching Fund<a href="#honigs-heroes-matching-fund" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>We have a matching fund that will match dollar for dollar the first
$100,000 raised, and we expect this matching fund to grow. (If you
would like to add to our matching fund, please get in touch!)</p>
<h1 id="make-a-donation">Make a Donation<a href="#make-a-donation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>



<a id='gfm-charity-donate-link' style='background-color:#673ab7; color: white; border-radius: 4px; padding: 12px 24px; display: inline-block; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: middle; font-size: 16px; font-family: Open Sans,sans-serif; line-height: 24px' role='button' href='https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/donate-widget/17557'>Donate</a>



<p>Every donor will be recognized for their donation on a plaque in the house. You can put whatever message you want, your mundane thoughts engraved for eternity! These names will live forever alongside the wainscotting. In addition, certain large gifts will be recognized with bannister posts, as well as the privilege to name specific objects (grease trap! toilets!) or locations in the house.</p>
<h4 id="allocation-of-funds">Allocation of Funds<a href="#allocation-of-funds" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>The money raised will be used to build an endowment fund. The
long-term goal is to have the annual income front his fund meet or
exceed the fixed costs of the property at 253 Commonwealth Ave
(Boston’s Champs-Elysee).</p>
<p>The house has not been crumbling, in fact, it has been dramatically improved recently by several substantial projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>All new bathrooms! Some with double shower heads!</li>
<li>Sprinkler updates! Less fire = good!</li>
<li>New heating and cooling system! Mr. Boiler go bye-bye!</li>
<li>and we are in the process of installing new windows and purchasing more exclamation marks!</li>
</ul>
<p>Wable to continue to maintain and improve the house while knowing that the foundation is solid. The current fixed costs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$40,000 Boston Property Taxes</li>
<li>$40,000 Current Mortgage. This mortgage will be paid off in XXX. We do not anticipate any additional mortgages, but would fund additional capital projects through reserves or additional fundraising through the MIT IRDF.</li>
<li>$10,000 Minimum utility expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>While some assumptions are required, we expect that a fund of
$1,222,000 will be able to generate over $50,00 per annum, covering
the taxes and utilities. The mortgage will be paid off through normal
operating revenue.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-help">How can you help?<a href="#how-can-you-help" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>You can help in a plethora of ways:</p>
<p><strong>First and foremost, you can donate!</strong> One time donations are great. Recurring donations are even better. All donations are great. If you can’t donate as much as you would want right now, make a pledge today and send your donations in over time. Click the link, send a check, deliver bearer bonds in the dead of night - please send something if you are able. (however please note: we have already received an excess of smedlys, ETs, and stone crabs.) See our list of splefty thank you gifts if you need motivation.</p>

<p><strong>You can also help with the house when the time comes to re-awaken the sleeping beast.</strong> There will be alumni workweek days, you can help with rush, and you can donate again and again!</p>
<p><em>Volunteer</em></p>
<p><strong>Finally, you can help keep the community active and alive.</strong> Join us at one of the many teply events scheduled, such as our Tech Reunion Dragon Launch Party, TEP Talks, the Annual Meeting and the Vrock (“Virtual Crock”, and yes, it will probably be as bad as that sounds - ideal for a crock!)</p>
<p><em>Events</em></p>
<h1 id="faq">FAQ<a href="#faq" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p><strong>Tax deductible?</strong>
No. Unfortunately we are not a 501(c)3, so donations are not tax deductible. It has something to do with the IRS thinking our membership is exclusive (if you can believe that!)</p>
<p><strong>How will we financially manage the donated funds?</strong>
We will put the endowment donations into conservative investments such as highly rated bond funds. If reasonable we will attempt to have this managed passively by the board in order to avoid fees associated with a management firm but will eb looking into low cost options for non-profits.</p>
<p><strong>What do we anticipate the Xi fixed costs being over time?</strong>
The fixed costs of keeping the house are ~$100,000 annually. This includes property taxes of ~$40,000, paying off the current mortgage, and paying for a minimum level of utilities and other services.</p>
<p><strong>How can I donate?</strong>
Boy I’m glad you asked that. There are lots of ways: x,y,z.</p>
<p><strong>What’s up with going co-ed?</strong>
Currently the house is occupied by two groups, everybody in the house belong to the Xi Fellowship which is co-ed, and the males in the house also are members of TEP Xi chapter. We continue to advocate for TEP National to formally admit both males and females.</p>
<p><strong>What happened in the Spring with the lockdown?</strong>
MIT asked all undergraduates to leave campus on March 17th. This included emptying our the FSILGs. MIT also asked all the FSILGs to remain empty for the summer (so no summer renters.)</p>
<p><strong>What is happening in the fall? Are the current active members going to live there again?</strong>
Currently MIT is only allowing rising seniors on-campus in the fall. No undergraduates who live off campus will be allowed on campus, and all the FSILGs will be empty in the Fall. We don’t know if MIT would allow, or if we can safely allow for any renters in the fall at all. The house will be empty.</p>
<p><strong>When can undergraduates live in the house again?</strong>
We don’t know for sure but most likely not until the Fall of 2021 given the current plans.</p>
<p><strong>What happens with Rush 2020? 2021?</strong>
Our TEPFORCE 2021 committee is exploring this.</p>
<p><strong>How will donors be recognized?</strong> Coming soon&hellip;</p>
